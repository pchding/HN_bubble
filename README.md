## News Bubble

Most recommendation engines try to discover users' preferences to give them the content that is similar to what they already like. This practice has created the so called "Filter Bubble", which separate users from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, and effectively isolate them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles. 

In this project, I propose a new kind of recommendation engine that aims to news post that is differnt from most other posts under similar topic.
