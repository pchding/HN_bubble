## News Bubble

Most recommendation engines try to discover users' preferences to give them the content that is similar to what they already like. This practice has created the so called "Filter Bubble", which separate users from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, and effectively isolate them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles. 

In this project, I propose a new kind of recommendation engine that aims to news post that is differnt from most other posts under similar topic. The news source I use is Hacker News, a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. Users of the website can submit news post (usually with some external link) to the websire for others to see, upvote and comment. However, Hacker News does not provide a topic categorization system (only posts concerning job posting, showcasing one's own work and questions to the community are categorized). With more than 500 posts every day, it has become hard to find posts that should interest you.

The project contains two part. In the first part, I build a topic categorization system based on post title, content and linked url
